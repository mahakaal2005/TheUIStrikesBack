-   **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI, Framer Motion (animations), Lucide React
-   **AI Integration:** "Tambo" AI SDK (React/TypeScript)
-   **Visualizations:** Recharts (Data Trends), Interactive Body Mapping
-   **Core Libraries:** Zod, date-fns, TipTap (Rich Text)

### Key Contributions & Features Implemented
*   **AI-Powered Clinical Tools:**
    *   **living Treatment Timeline:** Visualized complex patient history, combining vitals (HR, BP) with medical events for rapid clinical assessment.
    *   **Symptom Explainer & Medical Guide:** Engineered interactive AI agents that translate medical jargon into patient-friendly advice and step-by-step procedural guides.
    *   **Medical Image Analysis:** Integrated AI-driven image analysis simulating immediate clinical findings for X-rays and skin conditions.

*   **Advanced Data Visualization:**
    *   **Smart Lab Trends:** Built dynamic charts tracking lab results over time, highlighting critical trends and deviations for early intervention.
    *   **Body Map Selector:** Designed an interactive visual interface allowing patients to pinpoint symptom locations intuitively.

*   **Robust Dashboard Architecture:**
    *   **Unified UI System:** Architected a modular, reusable component library (Dashboard Widgets, Prescription Pads) ensuring design consistency across Patient, Doctor, Lab, and Pharmacy portals.
    *   **Responsive Application Design:** Delivered a fully responsive "mobile-first" experience with seamless animations and transitions using Framer Motion.

*   **Workflow Optimization:**
    *   **Clinical Productivity:** Streamlined pharmacy workflows with an AI Counseling Assistant, automating medication advice generation based on prescriptions.
